Jme3-maven is an ongoing voluntary effort by the JmonkeyEngine COMMUNITY to
provide usable jME3 binaries in the Sonatype Maven repositories.  When asking for
help with these Maven artifacts, please keep in mind that the core JmonkeyEngine
dev team is *not* maintaining these artifacts.     Currently your best source of
support is JMonkeyEngine community member stub22, who is attempting to update
and run the upload script about once per month, starting in December 2011.

This Github project houses two sets of artifacts:

	1) An upload script which we use to deliver the jME3 binary snapshots to
		the Sonatype "snaphots" area.   
		
		For basic information about using the uploaded jars in your own project,
		see README_using_jars.txt.
		
		For details about how we upload the jars, see README_sonatype_upload.txt.
		
	2) A set of currently out-of-date example pom.xml projects and maven archetypes.
		(This category includes most of the files in this github repo).  
		
		See README_demos_and_archetypes.txt.
