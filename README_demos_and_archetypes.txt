For basic information about using the jars in the Sonatype Maven 
repository, please see the README_using_jars.txt file.

The various jme3-* directories contain some example client projects
and maven archetypes, which are all currently OUT OF DATE.    Their
old usage notes follow:

Running the demos:
check out jme-demo-test and run "mvn exec:java"

Using the archetypes:
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=http://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/repositories/snapshots/content/

AGAIN, THESE NOTES REFER TO PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUT OF DATE!
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
